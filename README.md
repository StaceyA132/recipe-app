# recipe-app

I developed a recipe app that allows users to search for meals and view their ingredients effortlessly. Users can look up specific foods and navigate directly to their respective pages, streamlining the search experience. Additionally, the app features a favorites section where meals can be saved for quick access. To enhance usability, I implemented an alphabetical A-Z meal view, enabling users to browse meals by letter. Selecting a letter displays a list of corresponding meals, making exploration intuitive and efficient. Through this project, I strengthened my skills in API integration, data management, and UI/UX design to create a seamless and engaging user experience.
